            <h3>Course Description</h3>
            <p>A study of the Python programming language will be used as the vehicle to introduce advanced programming concepts.  At the end of the course, students should be able to analyze problems and develop their solutions by applying advanced flowcharting, coding and programming techniques.  Students should be able to design, develop, test and implement programs that involve nested conditional control structures, file handling, interactive processing, data editing, array processing, and sort and search algorithms.</p>

                variables, constants, arithmetic operators, and assignment statements, built-in 
                functions, program-defined value-returning functions, and program-defined void 
                functions.   Student will be learn to write C# programs that include classes, 
                polymorphism, overloading, exception handling, and interfacing with databases.</p>
